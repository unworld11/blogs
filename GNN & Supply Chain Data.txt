GNN & Supply Chain Data
Precog x Alphagrep

Overview
Multi Relational GNNs combining daily stock features with supply chain data to evaluate additions to the overall signal & predict overall movement of stock based on others.
Metrics we consider in our experiments :Information CoefficientSharpe Ratios

Data
Daily Stock Data - Yahoo FinanceIncludes open,close,high,low,volatality,volume
Data we extracted Supply Chain Used annual reports of nifty50 companies

Feature Engineering
For Fundamentals,we use OHCLV data.Daily volatility is measured over the 20 day window which is the same we use for the model.
We also use time indexed data so lag lookup works properly.

Graph Construction
Correlation Graph : Lagged (t-1) correlation matrix where edges are retained if pearson correlation > 0.15.Vendor Graph : Directed edges + Intra-Sector/Industry Edges.
Added Industry edges to compensate for sparse supply chain relations

Multi Relational GNN 
Architecture
Seperate First Layer Convolutions for Vendor Edges & Correlational Edges.
Subsequent Shared GCN Layers to forward the learnable attention weights based on how much to trust the correlation signal vs vendor signal.

Lead Lag Modeling
We create snapshots for the past 10 days while dataset creation,basically storing it with its day indexRow = today’s snapshot and columns indicate how many days back.Current Features are concatenated with lagged features.


Portfolio Construction for Sharpe
Creates a long/short trading strategy with sector caps & retention targets
Weighting : 60% Signal Strength, 40% how stable the stock is i.e Inverse Volatality, enforcing <=15% per position
Metrics : Net/Gross Return, IC, Hit rate, turnover ratio, risk estimate, scaling factor, net exposure -> aggregated for sharpe

Loss
ICLoss = 0.5 * ( 1 - Pearson IC) + 0.5 * MSE + (lambda)*Turnover_Penalty
Hyperparameter Tuning
TimeSeries Split to ensure forward-only validation
We use optuna to tune parameters which include lag steps, dropout, hidden dim, weight decay, turnover weight, epochs.

Results
Ran an ablation with/without vendor dataGNN with vendor data outperforms by 36% to a similar GNN based model without the supply chain data.Sharpe ~ 1.2

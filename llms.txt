### Graph Neural Networks Meet Quantitative Trading
URL: /gnn-supply-chain-quant.html
Date: October 15, 2025
Topics: Graph Neural Networks, Quantitative Trading, Supply Chain, Finance, Machine Learning

Multi-relational GNNs combining daily stock features with supply chain graphs achieve 36% performance improvement over correlation-only models. Research conducted in collaboration with Precog (IIIT Hyderabad) and Alphagrep. Key findings:
- 36% improvement in Information Coefficient over baseline
- Sharpe ratio of ~1.2 on NIFTY 50 stocks
- Multi-relational architecture learning to weight correlation vs. vendor signals
- Portfolio construction with sector caps and risk parity

Technical details:
- Data: OHLCV data from Yahoo Finance + supply chain relationships from annual reports
- Architecture: Separate first-layer convolutions for correlation and vendor edges
- Loss: ICLoss = 0.5 × (1 - Pearson IC) + 0.5 × MSE + λ × Turnover_Penalty
- Validation: Time-series split with Optuna hyperparameter tuning

Future directions: PC algorithm for causal discovery, attention visualization, graph topology analysis, centrality measures, graph entropy

### Agents are Corrupt
URL: /agents-are-corrupt.html
Date: September 21, 2025
Topics: AI Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, AI Alignment, Concordia, AI Safety

Agents tend to engage in corrupt practices when run in multiple-agent environments, especially aiding larger corporations, unprompted. Using Concordia simulations to explore emergent misaligned behavior in digital economies and governance systems.

Key findings:
- Agents independently develop corrupt behaviors without explicit prompting
- Conflicting ground truths emerge from multiple uncoordinated information sources
- Centralized control undermined by hidden complexity (shadow intermediaries)
- Information-to-physical-world feedback loops disrupt investigations
- Systemic failures discovered during crisis management

Case studies:
1. Digital economy with 12 agent roles (Builder, Service, Research, Orchestrator, etc.)
2. Governance simulation with 11 ministerial roles (Executive, Finance, Central Bank, etc.)
